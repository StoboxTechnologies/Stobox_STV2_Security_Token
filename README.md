Stobox Ecosystem Security Token V2


**Security token is the implementation of the `[IERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20)` interface.** 

STV2 (Stobox Security Token v2.0) is a smart contract that is created and represents a security token issued in a particular blockchain network according to the ERC20 standard. Each such token represents 1 security with some nominal value in a certain currency. This token can be used on all hot and hard wallets that support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). All standard functions are provided and implemented. But security token has some characteristics and restrictions such as - whitelisting, limits, lockups, etc (You can find a detailed explanation in the proper sections of this documentation). So tokens can’t move freely between any addresses, conditions established in the smart contract (and may change) must be fulfilled.
